# Force Subscribe helper functions
#
# Join Request Mode design (mirrors a known-working reference implementation):
#   1. Admin adds a channel in "request" mode -> we create a
#      creates_join_request=True invite link and show it as the Join button.
#   2. User taps it -> Telegram fires an on_chat_join_request event -> we
#      record {user_id, channel_id} in the DB. That's the ONLY signal we
#      trust for "request mode" channels - no extra live API calls that can
#      silently misbehave.
#   3. Next /start, we check the DB record first (fast + reliable), then
#      fall back to a direct get_chat_member (covers users who were already
#      an actual channel member before this feature was even turned on).
